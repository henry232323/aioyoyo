A port of oyoyo to Asyncio for Python 3.5+

Uses Asyncio instead of its original threading client. Creating an IRCClient instance will create the protocol instance.
To start the connection await IRCClient.connect();

oyoyo is an IRC library for Python, this project makes it completely asynchronous, with event callbacks
